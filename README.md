 WebApp Dashboard Project

Part of my Treehouse Techdegree course.

We were tasked with creating a single page web app based off mockup designs. 
This web app was designed to display multiple sources of user data to the user

 
The App was designed with  displaying some traffic data using Chart.js to make some nifty graphs.
The app also includes a mesage form feature with inbuilt validation, local storage options for settings, and a responsive mobile first design.

Created with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
